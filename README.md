## **Differential gene expression in snow crabs (*Chionoecetes opilio*) in response to different pH treatments**

I will be working with paired end RNA-Seq data prepared and provided by Laura Spencer. First, I will assemble a de novo transcriptome of snow crabs. Then, I will compare gene expression between juvenille snow crabs exposed to the following treatments: 
+ pH 7.5 for 12 weeks 
+ pH 7.5 for 8 hours
+ pH 7.8 for 12 weeks
+ pH 7.8 for 8 hours 
+ control
